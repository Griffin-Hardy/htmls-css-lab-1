<h2>Sully mannerisms</h2>

<p class="indent">The only time Sully ever meows is when we come home from somewhere, we can hear him behind the door meowing because he can hear us, this happens pretty much everytime we get home.</p>

<p class="indent">Whenever we open the door Sully likes to run out infront of our neighboring apartment and roll around in the dirt.</p>

<p class="indent">Instead of meowing sully likes to do what we call chirping he makes faint little sounds that sound "brrrt"</p>

<p class="indent">Sully was taken away from his brothers and sisters too early in his life, because of this sully plays much to hard, he bites a little too hard, and dosen't retract his claws while palying, its kindof a pain in the ass but we love him none the less </p>

<p class="indent">When Sully is being a sweet boy he really is the most loveable cat in the world. Sully loves to sit on our chests and nap. He will come curl up next us while we are sitting, as I am typing this he is curled up right next to my feet.</p>

<p class="indent">Sully is an incredibly hyperactive cat some times, when he gets like this his eye's get really big, and his ears get pointy and fold back, we like to say he does that because it makes him more aerodynamic while he runs and jumps around the apartment like a maniac.</p>
